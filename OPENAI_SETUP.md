## Setup Instructions üöÄ

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-`)

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

**Note:** The chatbot will work in fallback mode without an API key, but you'll get much better results with OpenAI integration.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (Already Done)

```bash
npm install openai
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the chatbot and look for the AI indicator
3. Ask complex questions like:
   - "What switch would you recommend for a 50-employee office with IP cameras?"
   - "Compare SonicWall vs Fortinet firewalls for my data center"
   - "I need a complete IT infrastructure setup for my startup"
